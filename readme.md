### **USE AND PURPOSE**
#### This application was built to help you with your grocery list. It allows for the following actions:
-Adding new items so you remember what you need (whatever color);   
-Deleting items that you don’t need anymore (red color);   
-Marking items already added to the basket and differing it from others you still need to get (change to grey color).

### **DEVELOPMENT**
#### ReactJS and plain CSS was used. The following hooks were used:
##### **useState** - for dynamically adding the item you need as an input
##### **useRef** – kept the input field mutable so that it can be marked as basket-ready or marked for deletion

### **HOW TO RUN**
You will need NodeJS on your computer, than you will need to run the following command:
```
npm start
```
