### **USE AND PURPOSE**
#### This application was built to help you with your grocery list, as you can add new items to buy to remember yourself what you need, you can delete items that you don't need anymore and you can also mark things as you get it on your basket (and it turns grey to help visualize and to differ of what you did not get yet)

### **DEVELOPMENT**
#### For study purposes I created this React Application and styled it using CSS. I used two React hooks, useState and useRef. useState were used to add state variables and render it, adding a value and updating it (adding the item you need to buy as an input). useRef kept my inputItem mutable but following the original structure, so I could properly add my inputs as an element that I could mark as bought (OK) or delete from my list.
